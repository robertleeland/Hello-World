# Hello-World
Introduction to Github

I just graduated from Concordia University Texas with a BA in Computer Science. There I primarily learned C++. Here I will be posting my work projects for Python, Java, and anything else I think I should be learning. I want to become comfortable programming anything that comes to mind and just be able to type it up.

My background was more focused as an US Navy Electronics Technician with computer and hardware troubleshooting and repair. I am learning to code to be able to create interesting things and also increase my work opportunities and skillset.
